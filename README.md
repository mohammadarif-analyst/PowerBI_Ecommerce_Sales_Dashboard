Goal of the Dashboard
To create an intuitive, interactive environment that supports management in optimizing product portfolios, enhancing category management decisions, and strategically segmenting customer outreach across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office groups.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals
The report is anchored by four key performance indicators: YTD Sales ($11.53M), YTD Profit ($1.34M), YTD Quantity (#107.2K), and YTD Profit Margin (11.58%). All KPIs include clear, color-coded YoY indicators.
